Creating a comprehensive chatbot for healthcare that serves both humans and livestock is a complex task. I can provide a basic outline and some sample code to get you started. Please note that this will require significant development, testing, and expertise in AI, healthcare, and software development.

Chatbot Architecture:

1. Natural Language Processing (NLP): Use libraries like NLTK, spaCy, or Stanford CoreNLP for text processing and understanding user inputs.
2. Knowledge Base: Develop a vast knowledge base covering human and livestock health conditions, symptoms, and treatments.
3. Machine Learning (ML): Utilize ML algorithms (e.g., decision trees, random forests, or neural networks) to analyze user inputs and provide personalized recommendations.
4. Integration: Integrate the chatbot with a database or API to store and retrieve user data, medical records, and knowledge base information.

Sample Code (Python):

import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB

# Define a function to process user inputs
def process_input(user_input):
    # Tokenize the input text
    tokens = word_tokenize(user_input)
    # Convert tokens to a numerical representation
    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
    input_vector = vectorizer.fit_transform(tokens)
    # Use ML algorithm to analyze the input
    clf = MultinomialNB()
    prediction = clf.predict(input_vector)
    # Return the predicted health condition
    return prediction

# Define a function to provide recommendations based on the predicted health
